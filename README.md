**To become a skilled DevOps engineer, Jenkins is a core tool you must master, as it is widely used for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). Below are the key Jenkins concepts you should learn and strategies to master them:**

-----------------------------------------

## Essential Jenkins Concepts for DevOps

1. **Jenkins Installation & Setup**
   - Installing Jenkins (on-premises, cloud, Docker)
   - Initial setup and security basics (user management, authentication)

2. **Jenkins Architecture**
   - Master-agent (controller-agent) architecture
   - Scaling with distributed builds

3. **Jobs & Pipelines**
   - Freestyle Jobs: Basic build jobs
   - Pipeline Jobs: Scripted and Declarative Pipelines (Jenkinsfile)
   - Multibranch Pipelines

4. **Jenkinsfile Syntax**
   - Pipeline DSL (Domain Specific Language)
   - Steps, stages, post, environment, parameters, etc.

5. **Build Triggers**
   - Poll SCM
   - Webhooks (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
   - Scheduled builds (cron-like syntax)
   - Manual triggers

6. **Build Executors and Nodes**
   - Configuring agents
   - Labeling, restricting jobs to specific agents

7. **Plugins**
   - Installing and managing plugins
   - Popular plugins: Git, Docker, Pipeline, Slack, Email, Blue Ocean, etc.

8. **Source Code Management (SCM) Integration**
   - Connecting Jenkins to Git, SVN, etc.
   - Handling credentials securely

9. **Artifacts & Build Management**
   - Archiving artifacts
   - Artifact promotion
   - Fingerprinting

10. **Testing & Quality Gates**
    - Integrating with testing frameworks (JUnit, TestNG)
    - Code coverage and static analysis plugins (SonarQube, Jacoco)

11. **Notifications & Reporting**
    - Email, Slack, MS Teams, etc.
    - Test result and build status reporting

12. **Credentials Management**
    - Storing and using secrets securely (Jenkins Credentials plugin)
    - Integrating with Vault or cloud secret managers

13. **Parameterization & Matrix Builds**
    - Parameterized jobs
    - Matrix builds for testing combinations

14. **Environment Management**
    - Using environment variables
    - Injecting secrets/configs

15. **Declarative vs Scripted Pipelines**
    - Knowing when to use each
    - Migrating Freestyle jobs to Pipelines

16. **Backup & Restore**
    - Jenkins home directory backup
    - Disaster recovery strategies

17. **Scaling & Performance**
    - Master-agent scaling
    - Monitoring Jenkins health

18. **Security Best Practices**
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    - Plugin security
    - Hardening Jenkins

1) Installing Jenkins (on Aws cloud)
   Initial setup and security basics (user management, authentication)

Install Jenkins.
Pre-Requisites:

Java (JDK)

Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins  

Install Java

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre

Verify Java is Installed

java -version

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
  s
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

**Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

EC2 > Instances > Click on
In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
Security groups
Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed All traffic).

Login to Jenkins using the below URL:
http://:8080 [You can get the ec2-instance-public-ip-address from your AWS EC2 console page]

Note: If you are not interested in allowing All Traffic to your EC2 instance 1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance 2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port 8080

After you login to Jenkins, - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword - Enter the Administrator password
